## Welcome

I am a current master's student in statistics at the UC San Diego Department of Mathematics. Prior to my time at UCSD, I was an undergradaute at UCLA studying applied mathematics. I find the fields of statistical learning, Bayesian inference, and high-dimensional data analysis particularly interesting. I am passionate about educating the general public on statistics and overall data literacy the age of growing information. The purpose of this website is to keep me accountable and organize my work.

I run a statistics blog [Matt's Statistics Notes](https://statisticalnotes.wordpress.com/) which I don't really expect anyone but myself to read. It's a collection of statistical theory and applications that I find particularly cool or useful
