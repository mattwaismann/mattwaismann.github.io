I am a current master's student in statistics at the [UC San Diego Department of Mathematics](https://math.ucsd.edu) expecting to graduate in December 2020. Prior to my time at UCSD, I was an undergradaute at UCLA studying applied mathematics. I find the fields of statistical learning, Bayesian inference, and high-dimensional data analysis particularly interesting. I am passionate about educating the general public on statistics and overall data literacy the age of growing information. The purpose of this website is to keep me accountable and organize my work.

I run a statistics blog [Matt's Statistics Notes](https://statisticalnotes.wordpress.com/) that I write mainly for myself but hope others would find interesting to read. The blog posts are mainly statistics related notes/topics I found particularly interesting or useful. 

You can also access my [github](https://github.com/mattwaismann) for projects (more soon to come!) 

I really enjoy teaching, particulary at the introductory level. At UCSD I have served as a teaching assistant for [MATH 11 - Calculus-Based Introductory Probability and Statistics](https://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/MATH.html) and [Math 189 - Exploratory Data Analysis and Inference](https://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/MATH.html).
