## Matthew Waismann
![](images/cover_img.jpg?raw=true)

In December of 2020, I graduated from the master's in statistics program at the [UC San Diego Department of Mathematics](https://math.ucsd.edu) . Prior to my time at UCSD, I was an undergraduate at UCLA studying applied mathematics. My interests are in the fields of Deep Learning, Bayesian inference, and high-dimensional data analysis. I am passionate about educating the general public on statistics and overall data literacy in this age of evergrowing information.


You can access my [github](https://github.com/mattwaismann) for projects (more soon to come!) 

I really enjoy teaching, particulary at the introductory level. At UCSD I have served as a teaching assistant for [MATH 11 - Calculus-Based Introductory Probability and Statistics](https://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/MATH.html) and [Math 189 - Exploratory Data Analysis and Inference](https://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/MATH.html).
